L2 Auth
-------
Simple Lineage 2 C4 server written as a learning exercise.

Why does this project exist?
----------------------------
Because it's fun; because I like Lineage 2 (at least until C4 and Interlude 
chronicles) and because I like the C programming language and I thought this 
is an excellent project to work with it.

Running the server with Docker
------------------------------
- Install docker
- Install docker-compose
- Run docker-compose up
- Server will start listening for connections on localhost (127.0.0.1) 
  ports 2106 (loginserver) and 7777 (gameserver)
- Use any user and password (all are valid) and you should be able to log in

Gameserver hot-code reload
--------------------------
- Run the game server
- Make a change in the code
- Run cd game/lib && make if not using docker, or
- Run docker-compose exec gameserver bash -c "cd game/lib && make" for docker
- Check the Lineage 2 client, the change should be reflected live

Lineage 2 Protocol
------------------
Lineage 2 uses TCP in order to send packets.

All integers are little endian.

The first two bytes of the packet contain the packet size and the third one, 
usually the packet type.

Other than the first packet, all packets are encrypted with blowfish using 
the following hardcoded key: ;5.]94-31==-%xT!^[$\000.

To do
-----
- [ ] Correctly handle big/little endian
- [x] Display terms of service view
- [x] Display server list
- [x] Allow to enter game server
- [x] Create character
- [x] Enter world
- [x] Walk
- [x] Handle multiple connections
- [] See other players

Awesome! Just open up an issue detailing what you will be working on, this way
we can be more organized with the work. After that, just have fun working on it!
